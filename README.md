# Neuroscience-Analysis-Class
Hands-on tutorials designed to teach common analysis techniques in academic Neuroscience research. Designed & Co-taught by Bee Massi and Genevieve Yang. 

The syllabus contains a brief description of the overall goals of the course, and what type of skills are taught each week. Each tutorial is VERY heavily annotated, as it is a comprehensive lesson on a particular topic.

The folders, labeled by week, contain the tutorials given to students with answers filled in. Necessary data files and functions are also included.

I have only included tutorials that I personally designed and wrote; Genevieve wrote the remaining tutorials. These tutorials mostly focus on analysis of choice behavior, and rudimentary model fitting & model selection.


Week 1: Introduction to MATLAB

Week 2: Analysis & Visualization of behavioral data

Week 3: Modeling of behavioral data and model selection

Week 8: Reinforcement-Learning models

Week 9: Modeling reaction times
